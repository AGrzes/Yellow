  name: The Church of the Celestial Spell
  description: "\_Medoere's major faith and official religion is Ruornil's Celestial Spell. By far, this is the most organized and powerful church dedicated to the Silver Prince. As a theocracy, Medoere's official religion serves as the law of the land as well as the keeper of the faith. The primary cathedral is the grand Temple of the Celestial Spell, located in Alamier City. A second major cathedral, the Temple of the Ninth Spell, is in the capital city of Braeme. It's a smaller but no less beautiful version of the Alamier complex.\n\nThe Celestial Spell has other temples, churches, and shrines throughout the three provinces. The theocracy controls all nine levels of temple in the domain. Although other faiths are tolerated, none have been allowed to establish any kind of holdings in the domain. (One is trying, though.)\n\nThe Celestial Archpriest serves as the leader of the church, though individual temples have local leaders who answer to the regent. The church dominates the three provinces as far as the power of faith is concerned. Because the theocracy is also in charge of foreign affairs and keeping the domain intact, it hasn't made many inroads into other realms. Indeed, the church isn't that interested in crossing political borders. After all, Ruornil specifically directed his faithful to settle the lands that became Medoere, so that's the region the church concentrates its efforts on.\n\nThat doesn't mean the church's influence hasn't spread. Due to the good relationship Medoere has with Roesone, shrines dedicated to Ruornil have been established in a few of Roesone's larger cities and towns. In the province of Caercas, however, Ruornil's Celestial Spell commands about 25% of the population's faith (the church has a level 1 holding in Caercas). Most of this is concentrated in the Temple of the Silver Moon, located in the city of Proudglaive."

  name: The Eastern Temple of Nesirie
  description: "The faith of Nesirie is popular among commoners, mariners, and the poor of Ilien. Things such as political intrigue and personal power are of no interest to the Temple of Nesirie, focusing more on actions than machination. This is significantly noted in the temple's holdings in the River Ward of the Free City. While walking through the ward, anyone not native to the city would most likely walk past the temple and not even know it. The leaders of the Nesiriean faith use their money for things other than elaborate cathedrals and elegant dress. Hence, their dwellings consist of renovated warehouses and century-old domiciles.\n\nA few years ago the Eastern Temple in Ilien fell upon some hard times. Many of the faithful of the Free City had gone to worship at the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn following their part in curing the plague in 546 MR. In the course of the next few months, the Eastern Temple was ready to pull out of Ilien and concede defeat to the Heart were it not for the zealous faith of Alliene Tilgentor. This young disciple refused to admit the citizens of Ilien cared nothing for the Goddess of the Sea, and began taking the teachings of Nesirie to the streets of the River Ward. Alliene's impassioned beliefs brought many of her fellow priests back from the brink of desperation, giving them the new hope and confidence the Eastern Temple needed to survive. The Eastern Temple of Nesirie is a level 3 temple holding under the control of the Council of Nesirie headed by\_Priestess Crennia Ylian (FA; Pr8; An, tainted, 11) and the Council of Seven including Alliene Tilgentor.\n\nThe Eastern Temple has strong ties to the trading community, and many merchants and mariners leave large offerings to Nesirie for her protection while traveling through the Straits of Aerele and the seas beyond. Even the guildlord el-Hadid contributes vast amounts of gold regularly to the Eastern Temple to insure the Lady of Mourning's protection. Though the faithful of the Eastern Temple of Nesirie are fewer than those of the Impregnable Heart, they have great influence in Ilien's large commerce network. Since the Heart concentrates its efforts with the nobility and rich in the castle ward, the Eastern Temple is the spiritual home of the poor and those finding themselves in hard times. New immigrants to the city have been increasing and the majority of them are counted among the poor."

Nine skilled warriors of the Golden Plumes are chosen to be the personal guard of the Count of Ilien when he is outside the castle.

  name: The House Bellamie
  description: >-
    The County of Bellam has been entrusted to the Bellamie family for well over
    700 years. For the great part of that time, the Bellamies were the vassals
    of the rulers of Aerenwe, and their county part of that kingdom. However,
    only 80 years ago Daen Roesone wrested Bellam away from Aerenwe and forced
    the king of that realm to cede him the province forever.


    To cement the alliance, Daen Roesone married his daughter Darliene to
    Stefhan Bellamie, then-Count of Bellam. The present Count Bellam is their
    son, Sedrie. Sedrie is somewhat arrogant and resentful of his family's
    allegiance to a much younger and less well-established line such as the
    Roesones. Sedrie is an only child, and has no children of his own yet, but
    he has five first cousins and a number of second cousins.


    It is said that Gavin Tael, Baron of Ghoere, has been trying to convince the
    Bellamies to change allegiances to his domain, an act that would certainly
    provoke a major war. He is offering to give the Bellamies rule of additional
    provinces if they come over to his side.

    After the baron's line, the most senior nobles are the Isilvieres of

    Roesone, the Isilvieres are one of only two families in Roesone that were
    acknowledged as titled nobility before the founding of Roesone. (The other
    one is the Bellamie family.) Derian Isilviere's oldest daughter Erin married
    Morghan Roesone, so the Isilviere blood is part of the Roesone line today.
    Fairfield is a county, and the leader of the Isilviere family is a count by
    birth. Other siblings and relations are lords and ladies. The Isilviere clan
    is currently led by Vaesin Isilviere, a hale old huntsman and falconer in
    his middle sixties. Vaesin served as one of the barony's leading knights and
    generals for many years before retiring to the Isilviere estates, and he has
    become a great outdoorsman in his leisure time. Vaesin was Derian's only
    son, and he has four sons of his own, plus no less than a dozen
    grandchildren. His son Daerin has only recently come to rule Fairfield.

  name: The House Roesone
  description: "The baron's line is descended from Daen Roesone, the Black Baron. Daen Roesone built a kingdom with his courage and his wits, and lived to pass it on to his heirs - one of the rarest and most difficult feats of statesmanship.\n\nThe House Roesone now consists of anyone directly descended from Daen Roesone. The direct descendent of Roesone's oldest child is the baron by virtue of senior rank; all other members of the house are lords or ladies.\n\n**The Family Today**: The oldest Roesone living today is Darliene, the Black Baron's daughter who was married to the Bellamie family. She is a spry 78 years of age; she inherited some part of her father's indomitable will and carefully watches over her son Sedrie's management of the county of Bellamie.\n\nRaederic Roesone (MA; Fl; Br, major, 24), the brother of Teried, and his wife Marsiye are the uncle and aunt of Marlae. If something should happen to both the baron and the baron's brother Daenal, Raederic is third in line for the throne. Raederic lives comfortably on a spacious ranch in central Edlin; he appears to have no aspirations to the throne. His daughter is\_Shielin (FA; F3; Br, major, 24), cousin to the baron. She is a beautiful young woman with a crusader's fire, constantly involving herself in issue after issue.\n\nThe black sheep of the Roesone line is the bastard son of Raemel, the Black Baron's first son. His mother is not known, but it is suspected that she was a servant in Raemel's household. Arvuor (MA; Fl; Br, tainted, 12) is a seasoned adventurer who has had to fend for himself for many years; his father was murdered when he was only five years old, and no Roesone was anxious to look after Raemel's indiscretion. Arvuor currently holds the title of Lord of Cariemas, one of Raemel's old titles that he assumed without challenge.\n\nLast but not least, Marlae has a younger brother by the name of Daenal (MA; F/Tl; Br, major, 24) who is the heir apparent until the reigning baron produces a legitimate child. Daenal is an excitable fellow with a short attention span; he likes to travel and often disappears from sight for weeks at a time. His title, Lord of Highglen, is reserved for the heir apparent.\n\n**The Roesone Bloodline**: The Black Baron's descendants have inherited a major bloodline derived from the goddess Brenna. This probably predates Daen Roesone's birth, but it's also possible that he activated or enhanced the bloodline by forging his kingdom. Several members of the family have manifested abilities tied with Brenna's blood, such as the ability to speak with cats or see through their eyes."

  name: The Impregnable Heart of Haelyn
  description: >-
    # Ilien


    The major faith center of the Ilienese is the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn, a
    level 4 temple holding under the control of the High Prefect Hubaere
    Armiedin. Worship of Haelyn has been present in Ilien since the battle at
    Mount Deismaar.


    When Ilien became a domain under the control of Lehoene Aglondier in 305 MR,
    a large group of Haelyn worshipers left the Dieman city of Aerele and came
    to the Free City. Lehoene greeted the Haelynites with open arms, gifting
    them with a portion of land in the then expanding Common Ward of the city.
    It was there the first Impregnable Heart of Haelyn temple was built.


    Despite financial assistance from the count, the Heart struggled for many
    years. In 546 MR, members of the Impregnable Heart singlehandedly cured a
    terrible plague that had begun to settle into the population of the Free
    City. In reward for their aid, Moeran Aglondier gave them a large section of
    the Castle Ward to build a new temple. The Heart built an awesome cathedral
    of higher learning and dedicated it to the faithful followers of Haelyn all
    across the land.


    The faithful of the Impregnable Heart consist of scholars, tradesmen,
    farmers, soldiers and others wishing the blessing of the patron of Anuire.
    The Impregnable Heart itself commands a great deal of respect in many
    factions of Ilien's government, and- priests of the Heart often perform as
    arbitrators and statesmen in diplomatic matters. Decisions made as
    arbitrators can be as small as determining who pays for a newly paved street
    in the Market Ward to as large as negotiating treaty terms between warring
    lands. Favors of the Impregnable Heart may be asked for and granted, but
    usually demand generosity of some sort in return.


    # Roesone


    The major faith of Roesone is the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn, one of the
    most powerful sects of Haelyn's faith. The temple predates Roesone's
    creation by many centuries; long before Daen Roesone built his barony here,
    the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn was a popular faith in Osoerde and Ilien.
    When Roesone was founded, the leaders of the temple immediately sent a party
    of priests and temple soldiers to build a temple to Haelyn's honor in
    Caercas, Roesone's capital. As the barony has grown, the temple has
    followed, and in the year 544 MR Teried Roesone declared the Impregnable
    Heart of Haelyn the official faith of the barony.


    The major citadel and cathedral of the Impregnable Heart is located in
    Ilien, and the local temple leaders answer to the High Prefect Hubaere
    Armiendin (MA; Prll; An, major, 27). The High Prefect enjoys good relations
    with all monarchs whose subjects follow his faith, and rarely feels the need
    to flex the temple's muscle in internal affairs. He is extremely satisfied
    with the temple's expansion and growth in Roesone.


    One of the Impregnable Heart's chief rivals is the Eastern Temple of
    Nesirie, headquartered in Aerenwe. High Prefect Hubaere of Haelyn's Temple
    feels that the Aerenweans should worship Haelyn too, since the people of
    Osoerde and Roesone (their immediate neighbors) follow Haelyn's faith. The
    High Prefect has even urged Roesone's lord to go to war with Aerenwefor
    religious reasons, but neither Roesone nor Aerenwe are that serious about
    their state faiths.


    The High Prefect also greatly resents the temple of Ruornil in Caercas, a
    base from which Archpriest Suris Enlien of Medoere (FA; Pr4, Ruornil; Re,
    major, 32) hopes to spread her faith and influence. The High Prefect is wise
    not to challenge her directly, however, and has thus far not taken any overt
    action against the priestess or her temple.


    Most of Roesone's provinces are home to one or two regional temples, large
    chapels housing anywhere from a dozen to a hundred priests, acolytes,
    scholars, and guards. Up to a dozen isolated shrines and parish temples are
    scattered around each province, each served by only one or two priests.
    There are also several monasteries hidden in the most inaccessible reaches
    of Roesone, where the cloistered priests of Haelyn withdraw for silence and
    contemplation.

  name: The Port of Call Exchange
  description: >-
    Guild holdings are important to the economic survival of any domain in
    Cerilia, and Ilien is no exception. The trading of foodstuffs, livestock,
    and other local items is essential to Ilien's survival and the prosperity of
    its citizens. For better or for worse, el-Hadid controls the largest and
    only guild holding in Ilien - the Port of Call Exchange, a level 7 holding.
    There are a few other guild operations in the Free City and the surrounding
    countryside, but none of them are capable of producing regency points or
    taxes.


    El-Hadid cares deeply for the quality and quantity of commerce that comes to
    Ilien in his own way - he could not have reached his current level of
    prosperity without it. El-Hadid does business with merchants and guildlords
    in several domains, bringing much-needed goods into the city, where he
    distributes the goods to retail merchant buyers through his guild holding,
    stores it for future use, or sells it to the Ilienese government.


    Goods sold to the state of Ilien are handled under Chancellor Moro Mentier,
    and usually consist of weapons, information and foodstuffs not normally
    available in Ilien. Chancellor Moro and el-Hadid do not particularly like
    each other, but they do have a good working relationship. El-Hadid knows
    better than to cheat or overcharge the chancellor, for Moro's scrutiny is
    very well kept. Moro has also learned not to pressure el- Hadid, or certain
    goods may become scarce or disappear altogether. It is a delicate
    relationship, with the well-being of the domain hanging in the balance. But
    even though some of el-Hadid's dealings are suspected of being felonious,
    much of what he does is well within the law.

    Description/History: Curan Ondier was raised in Goewhyn by his mother,
    Yeala. After her brief affair with the unscrupulous Soleme, Yeala was given
    a hundred gold pieces and told to disappear with her son into northern
    Ilien. Wanting nothing more to do with the wicked count, Yeala waited until
    Soleme was dead before telling Curan of his heritage. Riddled with
    questions, Curan sought out Moeran Aglondier to learn of his father's side
    of the family. Curan has assured the regent that he has no designs for the
    throne of Ilien, preferring the peaceful life of a farmer to that of a ruler
    of thousands.


    Curan is currently in his mid-forties and is the governing figure of the
    town of Goewhyn. Curan has a beautiful wife, Sasha, and three 16 year old
    fraternal triplets - boys Roeme, Torean, and Boerus. Each of the boys has
    recently begun to exhibit signs of being a blooded scion. Curan's greatest
    fear is that his sons will some day learn of their heritage and seek the
    throne, causing civil war. For that reason, he is attempting to raise them
    as farmers and not as warriors or wizards.

  name: Daeric Mhoried
  description: >-
    The Mhor, Daeric Mhoried (MA; R7; An, major, 46; CG), wards the kingdom of
    Mhoried. Descended directly from Endira Mhoried, the woman who received this
    domain from the hand of the second Roele, the Mhor takes his responsibility
    to the land seriously. Though some say another of his ancestors was the son
    of the Emperor, even the regent himself discounts this story. Apparently,
    the crusty old woodsman has no interest in the Iron Throne.


    This conscientious ruler tries to ensure that his laws do not interfere with
    his people living free and happy. He taxes them only to maintain the kingdom
    and levies only the laws that the people themselves demand—most demand none.
    His policy of lenience allows the Mhor to concentrate on military strategy
    to safeguard the lives of his people; his years of planning have made him a
    military genius.


    However, despite knowing he could lead his armies to the City of Anuire
    itself, Mhoried remains content in his home kingdom. His ambition died years
    ago, and now he seeks only to protect the people he has learned to love in
    his years as regent.

    Darien Avan (MA; F9; An, great, 70; LN), Prince of Avanil, runs not only his
    own kingdom, but significant portions of other provinces as well. Though he
    inherited much from his father, Veladan Avan, he has managed to amass an
    even greater portion of wealth and power than any had dreamed possible. It
    did help that partial stewardship of the City of Anuire itself passed to him
    with the death of his father. Nonetheless, Darien Avan capitalizes on any
    opportunity to expand his domain.


    The middle-aged prince seems well versed in the uses and abuses of power. He
    strives for law and moderation in all things, but he, like the Archduke of
    Boeruine, appears willing to sacrifice his compatriots to gain the Iron
    Throne. He believes that his knowledge of power will serve him well, and
    that he could be the best thing to happen to Anuire since Roele himself.
    None dare to gainsay him.

    AC: hp: THACO: #AT: 3(5) Dmg: Id4+1 16 19 1


    Bloodline: Brenna, tainted, 10


    Blood Abilities: Unreadable thoughts


    Equipment: Padded leather +3, dagger of venom, ring of human influence


    Description/History: El-Hadid is the most powerful, and the most deadly,
    trader in all of Ilien. If there is profit to be made in Ilien (or any of
    the surrounding domains), el-Hadid will let nothing stand in the way of his
    share. He is a man of elegant dress, exquisite tastes, and unruly
    voraciousness. The guildlord can be polite and understanding one minute, a
    fierce cutthroat who would steal the purse off a dead man the next.


    It is unknown where el-Hadid acquired the money to finance his immense
    trading enterprise. Rumors range from a wealthy inheritance to the theft of
    a deposed regent in far-off lands. In any case, el-Hadid appeared in the
    Free City of Ilien 12 years ago and immediately purchased a large section of
    the River Ward for his Port of Call Exchange. The Exchange is the largest
    trading company in southern Anuire, dealing in everything from fine silks to
    exotic wines to cattle and other live- stock. El-Hadid also has guild
    holdings in Roesone, Medoere and several other domains across Cerilia. It is
    also well known that el-Hadid is partial owner of the resort town of Aenier.


    El-Hadid is by far the most powerful and most dangerous NPC in all of Ilien.
    Some ten years ago, one of el-Hadid's chief competitors was mysteriously
    murdered, and since that time the guildlord's activities have been under
    some scrutiny by the constabulary. No charges of misconduct have ever been
    brought against el-Hadid, but prudent char- acters should be very careful
    when dealing with him or his men.


    El-Hadid employs nearly 400 traders, caravan masters and guards to protect
    his investments in Ilien. He has employees in additional domains, as well as
    other unknown contacts who serve in his network of spies and paid
    informants. He also has a secret arsenal of magical items (including his
    ring of human influence) which he uses to further his own greedy ends.


    One thorn in el-Hadid's side is his inability to dominate Ilien's cattle
    trade. This is due in part mostly to the interference of the late Moeran
    Aglondier. Moeran discovered el-Hadid's practices early on, but by then the
    Khinasi trader already had his hooks so deep into the Free City's economy
    that bringing him down completely would have seriously disrupted trade in
    the domain. Instead, Moeran set about making sure he did not gain control of
    the cattle market, saving Ilien's farmers from being cheated out of their
    own profits. Moeran then went one step further to help ensure true free
    trade in the - city by appointing chancellors Kathaen Abeth and . Moro
    Mentier. Both are former traders whose businesses were destroyed through
    el-Hadid's shady tactics, and both keep a sharp eye on Hadid. Agents of the
    chancellors also operate trading companies supported by the regent to offer
    competition to the Port of Call Exchange, making sure farmers and cattle
    herders receive fair prices for cattle they bring to Ilien, Goewhyn, or
    Tennien.

    This ruthless man drives himself to extremes in his quest for power. It
    remains a point of endless bitterness for him that all Anuire does not
    consider him one of the front-runners for the Iron Throne, but he has
    determined to gain it at whatever cost. In a way, he feels pleased that
    Boeruine and Avanil have focused their attentions so on each other—it makes
    his path to power that much easier.


    Tael, a man in his fifties, has iron-colored hair and a hard face. He keeps
    his eyes shuttered against all surprise and emotion, so as to betray nothing
    of his true feelings. This tactic makes him exceedingly difficult to read or
    understand, and there's no predictng what he'll do in a given situation. No

    Diemed's warrior baron, Heirl Diem (MA; F7; Br, major, 42; LN), is a direct
    descendant of the founder of Diemed. Those who deal with this canny
    politician and cunning strategist realize most of his actions have a secret
    motivation or form part of a trick; sometimes the baron uses this reputation
    to his advantage by doing exactly what he claims, and nothing more. For this
    reason, other regents fear engaging in diplomatic relations with him—they
    don't know what he intends, and they have few chances to find out before
    he's succeeded.


    The baron seeks perfect order in his kingdom and allows no lawbreaker to go
    unpunished. His justice is fair and even-handed, though, extending from the
    lowliest commoner to his own family. The punishments vary not in the
    slightest depending on social class. The baron does not believe in
    exceptions.


    *   **Lieutenants**: Diem has at least four trusted lieutenants who
    constitute an extensive spy network, in both his own and neighboring
    kingdoms. His secret sources allow him to quickly respond to internal
    threats or external pressures with a minimum of inconvenience. Some say his
    own daughter, Lasica (FA; W5; Br, major, 42; LN), works as one of these
    spies.

  name: Rogr Aglondier
  description: "Rogr Aglondier (MA; W3; Ma, minor, 21; NG) was an exceptional commoner once, a trusted adviser and apprentice to the blooded count before him, Moeran Aglondier. However, he did not descend from the ancient bloodlines. Rogr never felt so astonished as the morning he woke up to discover he had inherited the old man's bloodline, his royal name, and the Free County of Ilien. The count rules Ilien wisely and well, doing his best not to make the mistakes of the regents around him. Neither ambitious nor proud, he's willing to admit his faults. His people enthusiastically support him, for he keeps their loyalty high and their taxes low. Aglondier claims Ilien is neutral, a statement that strays a bit from the truth. He's good friends with the rulers from both Medoere and Roesone—without their tolerance, his domain wouldn't exist. Still, the nonpartisan illusion persists, so other rulers use the Free County of Ilien as a neutral meeting spot; regents have forged numerous treaties there.\n\n*   Lieutenants: Despite his many good qualities, Aglondier isn't really the trusting sort. His only lieutenant is his daughter and heir, the Lady Alliene (FA; Pr3, Nesirie; CG). Together, the two can react to nearly any emergency that arises in the kingdom.\n\n3rd-level Anuirean Wizard\n\nS: 14\n\nD: 14\n\nC: 11\n\nI: 16\n\nW: 14\n\nCh: 16\n\nBloodline: Masela, minor, 21\n\nBlood Abilities: Detect lie, enhanced sense (major ability; see rule book)\n\nEquipment: Robes, quarterstaff +2\n\nSpells/Day: 2/1\n\nPreferred Spells: 1st level—charm person, sleep;\n\n2nd level—stinking cloud\n\nDescription/History: Rogr Tilgentor has been the apprentice, supporter and friend of Moeran Aglondier for the past decade. Rogr was a com- moner, fascinated by magic, when he met the Count and became his pupil. He studied magic, though as an unblooded human had no chance of rising far in the ranks of true magic spellcasting. Moeran took him as an apprentice, and having no other family, made plans to pass the regency on to Rogr. Now, with Moeran's untimely death, the fledgling Rogr is thrust into the regency of Ilien unexpectedly.\n\nRogr is an extremely intelligent individual, and the power he possesses coupled with the teachings of the old Count and his own growing skill makes him a formidable ruler. Rogr is the only known wizard in Ilien.\n\nRogr is a widower, his wife having died during the birth of his daughter Alliene. Alliene is a member of the Eastern Temple of Nesirie, and Rogr's only trusted lieutenant.\n\nThe suspected assassination of Moeran has unnerved the new regent of the land. Despite the assurances of Seneschal Godene, Rogr remains extremely paranoid about a potential assassin loose in the Free City.\n\n*   Rogr was born as a son of simple craftsman and had fairly rough childhood\n*   He shown signs of great intellect was educated on the Moeran Aglondier stipend, and in time bacome clerk, apprentice, advisor and friend of count\n*   He became father early - at 17 and widower at 23\_\n*   In his magic he is great at practice - he is able to perform spell perfectly after reading it-s description once - but not so great at theory, abstraction and synthesis.\n*   He have a talent to combine magical and mundane means and knack for finding solutions that most mages would not think of.\n*   He see himself as a servant of the people of Ilien and legacy of Aglondier counts, he will ignore personal attacks but fight fierce when city is threatened\n*   He is not accustomed to political maneuvering, he knows it happen but until recently he was focusing on finding best solutions not making them pass amid resistance\n*   He likes cooking and do not think to stop even when he is a count\n*   He was accustomed to work directly with the count and do not know who of the numerous advisors and officials can he trust and with what\n*   He often wears old hat - a gift from late wife - as remembrance of her - even when it is not very fitting occasion"

  name: The Seadrake
  description: >-
    About 600 years ago, when the Roeles still lived to rule Anuire, an Anuirean
    merchant named Garrilein Suliere sailed the Straits of Aerele, selling
    grains, steel, and fabrics from Anuire in Mieres, and returning with a cargo
    hold full of gold and spices. It was a good life; he profited from the trade
    and helped make others wealthy as well.


    Occasionally, he would supplement his cargo with passengers. One mysterious
    passenger, who paid his weight in gold, proved to be Garrilein's undoing.
    Though the passage across the Straits lasts only a day, this day would
    irrevocably change Garrilein's life.


    A storm boiled up, and the passenger's cloak was blown from his face. He was
    scaled and horned, a horrible lizard-like creature, and he began to
    slaughter the crew where they stood. Though Garrilein was only an average
    warrior, he couldn't stand idle while his crew was slaughtered. Summoning
    all his meager courage, he crept up behind the beast and drove a harpoon
    through its back. It expired on the harpoon, cursing him all the while.


    Whether it was the curse, or whether the slaying awoke Garrilein's latent
    blood, he gradually took on the beast's scales over the next few years. He
    soon could not show his face in public and was forced to deal through
    intermediaries and couriers. His appearance continued to worsen, until at
    last he slipped into the sea in an attempt to kill himself.


    He found that immersion in water couldn't kill him; instead, the salt water
    of the Straits hastened his transformation and he eventually became a small
    sea serpent. The years have rendered him larger and more powerful; and
    although he is not actively evil, his transformation continues without
    cease.


    Although he now has little use for it, the Seadrake still collects treasure.
    Though he can no longer increase his fortune through honest work, he can now
    take it from the captains of the vessels that ply the Straits of Aerele. He
    has terrorized ships for the past 500 years, and after the first few
    decades, few dared deny him the treasure he seeks.


    However, the Seadrake does not take lives unless forced to do so in
    self-defense. He makes an exception for the pirate ships that attempt to
    steal what would be his. Apparently, he feels some obligation to earn the
    money he takes from the merchants; killing the pirates is his trade-off.


    The Seadrake appears as a 50-foot-long serpent with a large, fan-like crest
    adorning his back. He is mottled green and blue, and he blends easily into
    the sometimes turbulent waters of the Straits. Fangs fill his mouth, and the
    flukes on his forequarters propel him powerfully through the water. He bears
    no trace of his former humanity except for his morals and his ability to
    understand all human speech.


    The Seadrake can breathe both water and air without difficulty, but he has
    trouble moving on land. Although he has been known to pursue enemies onto
    dry land, he prefers the water, where he's more maneuverable and more
    dangerous.


    **Combat**: Ship captains give tribute to the Seadrake with little fuss for
    good reason. His bite causes 3dlO damage, enough to rend a normal man in a
    single pass of razor-sharp teeth. Alternatively, he can make a crushing
    attack with his two tremendous flukes, each causing 2d8 damage. Any
    breakable object must save vs. crushing blow when hit by his flippers or be
    shattered.


    The Seadrake has recently discovered that his great size confers two
    additional forms of attack. He is now of a size such that he can swallow
    man-sized enemies; when he attacks with his bite, a roll of a natural 19 or
    20 means that his victim has been swallowed whole. The victim suffers 1d20
    damage passing over rows of teeth and into the Seadrake's gullet, then has
    Id6 rounds to cut himself free (by causing 20 points of damage to AC 5)
    before he drowns and burns to death in powerful stomach bile. Only weapons
    of size S can be used to cut him; there is no room to wield larger weapons.


    The creature's other newly found attack is his crushing coil. He can wrap
    his length around any ship with a deck width of 20 feet or less and crush
    it. If the ship's wood fails a save vs. crushing blow, the hull splinters
    and the ship slowly sinks.


    The Seadrake can spit an ink-cloud from under his flukes to assist his
    escape. The ink acts as a darkness spell with a 50- foot radius underwater;
    it is ineffective above water.


    The Seadrake regenerates 2 hp per round while his wounds are underwater. If
    a wound is exposed to air for more than 3 rounds, it must heal normally. If
    reduced to -10 hit points, the Seadrake dies.


    **Habitat/Society**: The Seadrake has no society. He lives alone in a grotto
    under Baerghos Isle, gazing upon his treasure. A primitive tribe is said to
    live on the isle and worship the Seadrake as a god, but no one has set foot
    on the island in over two centuries to verify this.


    **Ecology**: The Seadrake patrols the Straits of Aerele, eating sharks and
    whales. If these are not available, he can survive on plankton or seaweed.
    He drags the tribute donated to him by sailors eager to avoid his wrath to
    his under- water grotto. A few reckless adventurers have pilfered from this
    grotto over the years, and many more plan carefully to enter when the
    Seadrake is away, but this is a foolish venture, for the Seadrake keeps no
    schedule, and can return at any instant. Despite his generally passive
    nature, he will kill anyone who tampers with his treasure. Although he has
    no use for the treasure, he enjoys its company and guards it jealously.


    A theory has been offered that the Seadrake collects treasure to remind him
    of his lost humanity. Some say he would do anything to regain that life, or
    to end this one. They're wrong in one respect - he fights viciously when
    attacked, as if he were afraid of death.


    Travelers on the Straits should be warned: Though the Seadrake can be
    bargained with, he demands tribute. He is nothing less than unreasonable if
    denied. No one has lived to tell a tale of escaping the Seadrake by
    promising to return with more gold. Though he is greedy, he is not stupid.
    No one escapes an encounter with the Seadrake with a full purse.

    # Blood Derivation


    A character can be a scion of one of the old goods


    *   Andurias, the god of noble war

    *   Azrai the shadow, the face of evil

    *   Basaia, the queen of the sun

    *   Brenna, the goddess of commerce and fortune

    *   Masela, the lady of the seas

    *   Reynir, the god of the woods and streams

    *   Vorynn, the lord of moon and magic


    Scions of Azrai are called awnsheling (awnsheghlien) and are twisted by the
    dark power.


    # Blood Strength


    Bloodline could have following strength


    *   Tainted

    *   Minor

    *   Major

    *   Great

    *   True


    Tainted bloodlines are almost completely degenerated or are new bloodlines
    created by bloodtheft by unbloodied character.


    Minor bloodlines are usually descendants of common men present at Deismaar.


    Major bloodlines are usually descendants of commanders and heroes of Deismar
    or minor bloodlines elevated by heroic deeds.


    Great bloodlines are usually descendants of greatest heroes of Deismar or
    major bloodlines elevated by epic deeds.


    True bloodlines are direct descendants of divine champions fighting at
    Deismar .


    # Bloodline Score


    Bloodline score is described by integer number. Bloodied player character
    starts with score of 5 plus 10 points for each strength level after tainted.


    # Investiture


    By performing a complex ritual character can pass his bloodline to another.
    Both characters have to be present and willing (but may be coerced).


    If target is unbloodied it gains source character's derivation, score and
    strength.


    If target is bloodied it gains one half of the source's score. Target
    retains stronger bloodline strength. The person performing ritual decides
    about derivation.


    Source become unbloodied.


    # Bloodtheft


    When bloodied character is slain by piercing the heart the killer can get
    part of victim power. He gets one point per level of target bloodline
    strength (but no more than target score). If killer is unbloodied he gains
    Tainted bloodline of victim's derivation.


    If the kill is made with _tighmaevril_ weapon it grants one half of the
    target bloodline score and the kill does not have to pierce the heart.


    If the victim have different bloodline derivation then the killer then the
    killer have to success on charisma medium (15) saving throw or gain victim's
    derivation. If the victim blood is stronger then the save is done at
    disadvantage, if weaker then at advantage. If the victim is of Azrai blood
    then the save is though (20).


    # Offspring


    When bloodied character breed the offspring can inherit the power. The child
    have stronger parent blood strength, average of both parents scores and
    stronger parent's derivation (in case of ties score decides, then fate). If
    one of parents is unbloodied then progeny have one half of bloodied parent
    score, one level lesser strength and the same derivation.


    # Improving Bloodline


    Bloodied regent can draw power from the land to improve his bloodline score.
    The bloodline strength can be only archived by heroic (or in case of Azrai
    horrific) deeds.


    ## Bloodmark


    Blooded character is marked as a scion by some visible body alteration, like
    birthmark, strangely colored strand of hair or something similar. Bloodmark
    become more pronounced as blood becomes stronger. Characters recognizing
    bloodline can react accordingly.


    # Heritage

    attributes based on derivation


    *   Anduiras - Str

    *   Reynir - Con

    *   Brenna - Dex

    *   Basaia - Int

    *   Masela - Cha

    *   Vorynn - Wis

    *   Azrai - choose two


    # Blood abilities


    For each started 10 points of bloodline score the character posses one blood
    ability. Character cannot have ability more potent than his bloodline
    strength. Character should not have more stronger abilities than weaker.
    There are no specific list of abilities only suggestions of the ability
    power level, abilities should be thematically linked to blood derivation.

    A year has 388 days. The four annual days not part of any month have become
    times to celebrate and reflect. These days fall on the vernal equinox (the
    Day of Rebirth), the summer solstice (the Night of Fire, when a shower of
    falling stars results from annual passage through a meteor belt at the
    climax of Haelyn's Festival), the autumnal equinox (the Veneration of the
    Sleeping), and the winter solstice (the Eve of the Dead).


    # Months, days, and years


    The 12 months of the Anuirean calendar begin with the Day of Rebirth, the
    vernal equinox. The month Sarimiere is the first of the new year, followed
    by Talienir, then Roelir. After Haelyn's Festival, the month of Haelynir
    begins. Anarire and Deismir (named for the Godswar's final battle) follow in
    succession, with the Veneration of the Sleeping next. Erntenir, the month of
    harvest, leads to Sehnir, then Emmanir, just before the Eve of the Dead.
    Then comes the coldest month, Keltier, which flows into Faniele, then
    Pasiphiel, and again, the Day of Rebirth.


    Anuireans devote six of the week's eight days to work, giving the remainder
    over to leisure. The days, from work's beginning to rest's end, are: Firlen,
    Relen, Dielen, Varilen, Branlen, Barlen, Mierlen, and Taelen.


    Almost 2,000 years after the destruction of the old gods, Anuire's current
    yearly reckoning is 551 Michaeline (551MR), or 551 years after the death of
    Michael Roele, last Emperor of Anuire. In Khinasi lands, the year is 2039 MA
    (dating from the Masetian Arrival in Cerilia). In certain other parts of
    Cerilia, the year is 1524 HC (Haelyn's Count), recording the years since the
    battle of Mount Deismaar.
