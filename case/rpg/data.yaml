- type: Organization
  name: The Church of the Celestial Spell
  description: "\_Medoere's major faith and official religion is Ruornil's Celestial Spell. By far, this is the most organized and powerful church dedicated to the Silver Prince. As a theocracy, Medoere's official religion serves as the law of the land as well as the keeper of the faith. The primary cathedral is the grand Temple of the Celestial Spell, located in Alamier City. A second major cathedral, the Temple of the Ninth Spell, is in the capital city of Braeme. It's a smaller but no less beautiful version of the Alamier complex.\n\nThe Celestial Spell has other temples, churches, and shrines throughout the three provinces. The theocracy controls all nine levels of temple in the domain. Although other faiths are tolerated, none have been allowed to establish any kind of holdings in the domain. (One is trying, though.)\n\nThe Celestial Archpriest serves as the leader of the church, though individual temples have local leaders who answer to the regent. The church dominates the three provinces as far as the power of faith is concerned. Because the theocracy is also in charge of foreign affairs and keeping the domain intact, it hasn't made many inroads into other realms. Indeed, the church isn't that interested in crossing political borders. After all, Ruornil specifically directed his faithful to settle the lands that became Medoere, so that's the region the church concentrates its efforts on.\n\nThat doesn't mean the church's influence hasn't spread. Due to the good relationship Medoere has with Roesone, shrines dedicated to Ruornil have been established in a few of Roesone's larger cities and towns. In the province of Caercas, however, Ruornil's Celestial Spell commands about 25% of the population's faith (the church has a level 1 holding in Caercas). Most of this is concentrated in the Temple of the Silver Moon, located in the city of Proudglaive."

  name: The Eastern Temple of Nesirie
  description: "The faith of Nesirie is popular among commoners, mariners, and the poor of Ilien. Things such as political intrigue and personal power are of no interest to the Temple of Nesirie, focusing more on actions than machination. This is significantly noted in the temple's holdings in the River Ward of the Free City. While walking through the ward, anyone not native to the city would most likely walk past the temple and not even know it. The leaders of the Nesiriean faith use their money for things other than elaborate cathedrals and elegant dress. Hence, their dwellings consist of renovated warehouses and century-old domiciles.\n\nA few years ago the Eastern Temple in Ilien fell upon some hard times. Many of the faithful of the Free City had gone to worship at the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn following their part in curing the plague in 546 MR. In the course of the next few months, the Eastern Temple was ready to pull out of Ilien and concede defeat to the Heart were it not for the zealous faith of Alliene Tilgentor. This young disciple refused to admit the citizens of Ilien cared nothing for the Goddess of the Sea, and began taking the teachings of Nesirie to the streets of the River Ward. Alliene's impassioned beliefs brought many of her fellow priests back from the brink of desperation, giving them the new hope and confidence the Eastern Temple needed to survive. The Eastern Temple of Nesirie is a level 3 temple holding under the control of the Council of Nesirie headed by\_Priestess Crennia Ylian (FA; Pr8; An, tainted, 11) and the Council of Seven including Alliene Tilgentor.\n\nThe Eastern Temple has strong ties to the trading community, and many merchants and mariners leave large offerings to Nesirie for her protection while traveling through the Straits of Aerele and the seas beyond. Even the guildlord el-Hadid contributes vast amounts of gold regularly to the Eastern Temple to insure the Lady of Mourning's protection. Though the faithful of the Eastern Temple of Nesirie are fewer than those of the Impregnable Heart, they have great influence in Ilien's large commerce network. Since the Heart concentrates its efforts with the nobility and rich in the castle ward, the Eastern Temple is the spiritual home of the poor and those finding themselves in hard times. New immigrants to the city have been increasing and the majority of them are counted among the poor."

For the common soldier, there is no greater honor than to become a member of this corps. Nine skilled warriors of the Golden Plumes are chosen to be the personal guard of the Count of Ilien when he is outside the castle. The Golden Plumes are led by\_General Wynn Zoest (MA; F6; An, tainted, 10), an aged veteran of the Guard Watch of nearly 40 years. General Zoest reports only to Chamberlain Ja'teem, the Lord Mayor, and Ilien's regent. Should the Free City ever be under siege, Zoest would be command- ing the city's defenses."

  name: The House Bellamie
  description: >-
    The County of Bellam has been entrusted to the Bellamie family for well over
    700 years. For the great part of that time, the Bellamies were the vassals
    of the rulers of Aerenwe, and their county part of that kingdom. However,
    only 80 years ago Daen Roesone wrested Bellam away from Aerenwe and forced
    the king of that realm to cede him the province forever.


    To cement the alliance, Daen Roesone married his daughter Darliene to
    Stefhan Bellamie, then-Count of Bellam. The present Count Bellam is their
    son, Sedrie. Sedrie is somewhat arrogant and resentful of his family's
    allegiance to a much younger and less well-established line such as the
    Roesones. Sedrie is an only child, and has no children of his own yet, but
    he has five first cousins and a number of second cousins.


    It is said that Gavin Tael, Baron of Ghoere, has been trying to convince the
    Bellamies to change allegiances to his domain, an act that would certainly
    provoke a major war. He is offering to give the Bellamies rule of additional
    provinces if they come over to his side.

  name: The House Isilviere
  description: >-
    After the baron's line, the most senior nobles are the Isilvieres of

    Roesone, the Isilvieres are one of only two families in Roesone that were
    acknowledged as titled nobility before the founding of Roesone. (The other
    one is the Bellamie family.) Derian Isilviere's oldest daughter Erin married
    Morghan Roesone, so the Isilviere blood is part of the Roesone line today.
    Fairfield is a county, and the leader of the Isilviere family is a count by
    birth. Other siblings and relations are lords and ladies. The Isilviere clan
    is currently led by Vaesin Isilviere, a hale old huntsman and falconer in
    his middle sixties. Vaesin served as one of the barony's leading knights and
    generals for many years before retiring to the Isilviere estates, and he has
    become a great outdoorsman in his leisure time. Vaesin was Derian's only
    son, and he has four sons of his own, plus no less than a dozen
    grandchildren. His son Daerin has only recently come to rule Fairfield.

  name: The House Roesone
  description: "The baron's line is descended from Daen Roesone, the Black Baron. Daen Roesone built a kingdom with his courage and his wits, and lived to pass it on to his heirs - one of the rarest and most difficult feats of statesmanship.\n\nThe House Roesone now consists of anyone directly descended from Daen Roesone. The direct descendent of Roesone's oldest child is the baron by virtue of senior rank; all other members of the house are lords or ladies.\n\n**The Family Today**: The oldest Roesone living today is Darliene, the Black Baron's daughter who was married to the Bellamie family. She is a spry 78 years of age; she inherited some part of her father's indomitable will and carefully watches over her son Sedrie's management of the county of Bellamie.\n\nRaederic Roesone (MA; Fl; Br, major, 24), the brother of Teried, and his wife Marsiye are the uncle and aunt of Marlae. If something should happen to both the baron and the baron's brother Daenal, Raederic is third in line for the throne. Raederic lives comfortably on a spacious ranch in central Edlin; he appears to have no aspirations to the throne. His daughter is\_Shielin (FA; F3; Br, major, 24), cousin to the baron. She is a beautiful young woman with a crusader's fire, constantly involving herself in issue after issue.\n\nThe black sheep of the Roesone line is the bastard son of Raemel, the Black Baron's first son. His mother is not known, but it is suspected that she was a servant in Raemel's household. Arvuor (MA; Fl; Br, tainted, 12) is a seasoned adventurer who has had to fend for himself for many years; his father was murdered when he was only five years old, and no Roesone was anxious to look after Raemel's indiscretion. Arvuor currently holds the title of Lord of Cariemas, one of Raemel's old titles that he assumed without challenge.\n\nLast but not least, Marlae has a younger brother by the name of Daenal (MA; F/Tl; Br, major, 24) who is the heir apparent until the reigning baron produces a legitimate child. Daenal is an excitable fellow with a short attention span; he likes to travel and often disappears from sight for weeks at a time. His title, Lord of Highglen, is reserved for the heir apparent.\n\n**The Roesone Bloodline**: The Black Baron's descendants have inherited a major bloodline derived from the goddess Brenna. This probably predates Daen Roesone's birth, but it's also possible that he activated or enhanced the bloodline by forging his kingdom. Several members of the family have manifested abilities tied with Brenna's blood, such as the ability to speak with cats or see through their eyes."

  name: The Impregnable Heart of Haelyn
  description: >-
    # Ilien


    The major faith center of the Ilienese is the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn, a
    level 4 temple holding under the control of the High Prefect Hubaere
    Armiedin. Worship of Haelyn has been present in Ilien since the battle at
    Mount Deismaar.


    When Ilien became a domain under the control of Lehoene Aglondier in 305 MR,
    a large group of Haelyn worshipers left the Dieman city of Aerele and came
    to the Free City. Lehoene greeted the Haelynites with open arms, gifting
    them with a portion of land in the then expanding Common Ward of the city.
    It was there the first Impregnable Heart of Haelyn temple was built.


    Despite financial assistance from the count, the Heart struggled for many
    years. In 546 MR, members of the Impregnable Heart singlehandedly cured a
    terrible plague that had begun to settle into the population of the Free
    City. In reward for their aid, Moeran Aglondier gave them a large section of
    the Castle Ward to build a new temple. The Heart built an awesome cathedral
    of higher learning and dedicated it to the faithful followers of Haelyn all
    across the land.


    The faithful of the Impregnable Heart consist of scholars, tradesmen,
    farmers, soldiers and others wishing the blessing of the patron of Anuire.
    The Impregnable Heart itself commands a great deal of respect in many
    factions of Ilien's government, and- priests of the Heart often perform as
    arbitrators and statesmen in diplomatic matters. Decisions made as
    arbitrators can be as small as determining who pays for a newly paved street
    in the Market Ward to as large as negotiating treaty terms between warring
    lands. Favors of the Impregnable Heart may be asked for and granted, but
    usually demand generosity of some sort in return.


    # Roesone


    The major faith of Roesone is the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn, one of the
    most powerful sects of Haelyn's faith. The temple predates Roesone's
    creation by many centuries; long before Daen Roesone built his barony here,
    the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn was a popular faith in Osoerde and Ilien.
    When Roesone was founded, the leaders of the temple immediately sent a party
    of priests and temple soldiers to build a temple to Haelyn's honor in
    Caercas, Roesone's capital. As the barony has grown, the temple has
    followed, and in the year 544 MR Teried Roesone declared the Impregnable
    Heart of Haelyn the official faith of the barony.


    The major citadel and cathedral of the Impregnable Heart is located in
    Ilien, and the local temple leaders answer to the High Prefect Hubaere
    Armiendin (MA; Prll; An, major, 27). The High Prefect enjoys good relations
    with all monarchs whose subjects follow his faith, and rarely feels the need
    to flex the temple's muscle in internal affairs. He is extremely satisfied
    with the temple's expansion and growth in Roesone.


    One of the Impregnable Heart's chief rivals is the Eastern Temple of
    Nesirie, headquartered in Aerenwe. High Prefect Hubaere of Haelyn's Temple
    feels that the Aerenweans should worship Haelyn too, since the people of
    Osoerde and Roesone (their immediate neighbors) follow Haelyn's faith. The
    High Prefect has even urged Roesone's lord to go to war with Aerenwefor
    religious reasons, but neither Roesone nor Aerenwe are that serious about
    their state faiths.


    The High Prefect also greatly resents the temple of Ruornil in Caercas, a
    base from which Archpriest Suris Enlien of Medoere (FA; Pr4, Ruornil; Re,
    major, 32) hopes to spread her faith and influence. The High Prefect is wise
    not to challenge her directly, however, and has thus far not taken any overt
    action against the priestess or her temple.


    Most of Roesone's provinces are home to one or two regional temples, large
    chapels housing anywhere from a dozen to a hundred priests, acolytes,
    scholars, and guards. Up to a dozen isolated shrines and parish temples are
    scattered around each province, each served by only one or two priests.
    There are also several monasteries hidden in the most inaccessible reaches
    of Roesone, where the cloistered priests of Haelyn withdraw for silence and
    contemplation.

  name: The Port of Call Exchange
  description: >-
    Guild holdings are important to the economic survival of any domain in
    Cerilia, and Ilien is no exception. The trading of foodstuffs, livestock,
    and other local items is essential to Ilien's survival and the prosperity of
    its citizens. For better or for worse, el-Hadid controls the largest and
    only guild holding in Ilien - the Port of Call Exchange, a level 7 holding.
    There are a few other guild operations in the Free City and the surrounding
    countryside, but none of them are capable of producing regency points or
    taxes.


    El-Hadid cares deeply for the quality and quantity of commerce that comes to
    Ilien in his own way - he could not have reached his current level of
    prosperity without it. El-Hadid does business with merchants and guildlords
    in several domains, bringing much-needed goods into the city, where he
    distributes the goods to retail merchant buyers through his guild holding,
    stores it for future use, or sells it to the Ilienese government.


    Goods sold to the state of Ilien are handled under Chancellor Moro Mentier,
    and usually consist of weapons, information and foodstuffs not normally
    available in Ilien. Chancellor Moro and el-Hadid do not particularly like
    each other, but they do have a good working relationship. El-Hadid knows
    better than to cheat or overcharge the chancellor, for Moro's scrutiny is

  description: >-
    The Spider River Traders began as a group of loggers and a sawmill who
    harvested the southern marches of the Spiderfell. This risky operation was
    not without setbacks and losses, but overall the high demand for the
    Spiderfell's wood made it a very profitable venture. Siele's father expanded
    the guild to include the bargemen of the upper Spider, and handed a network
    of interests and investments to her when he retired.

Unfortunately for him, his domain lies across the Straits of Aerele from the Anuirean mainland. That's nowhere near the center of politics, so he spends his time plotting ever-greater control over his lands. Vaumel completely controls guild activity in\_ Mieres. He brooks no competitors for the gold the network brings him; those who try opposing him usually wash up sooner or later on the former colony's sandy shores. The governor feels less than concerned about the law; everyone knows that if they try anything, his squad of thugs will make examples of them.\n\nThe Prince of Avanil has the governor's sworn fealty.

    Description/History: Curan Ondier was raised in Goewhyn by his mother,
    Yeala. After her brief affair with the unscrupulous Soleme, Yeala was given
    a hundred gold pieces and told to disappear with her son into northern
    Ilien. Wanting nothing more to do with the wicked count, Yeala waited until
    Soleme was dead before telling Curan of his heritage. Riddled with
    questions, Curan sought out Moeran Aglondier to learn of his father's side
    of the family. Curan has assured the regent that he has no designs for the
    throne of Ilien, preferring the peaceful life of a farmer to that of a ruler
    of thousands.


    Curan is currently in his mid-forties and is the governing figure of the

    This conscientious ruler tries to ensure that his laws do not interfere with

    and levies only the laws that the people themselves demand—most demand none.

    However, despite knowing he could lead his armies to the City of Anuire

    Equipment: Padded leather +3, dagger of venom, ring of human influence


    Description/History: El-Hadid is the most powerful, and the most deadly,
    trader in all of Ilien. If there is profit to be made in Ilien (or any of
    the surrounding domains), el-Hadid will let nothing stand in the way of his
    share. He is a man of elegant dress, exquisite tastes, and unruly
    voraciousness. The guildlord can be polite and understanding one minute, a
    fierce cutthroat who would steal the purse off a dead man the next.


    It is unknown where el-Hadid acquired the money to finance his immense
    trading enterprise. Rumors range from a wealthy inheritance to the theft of
    a deposed regent in far-off lands. In any case, el-Hadid appeared in the
    Free City of Ilien 12 years ago and immediately purchased a large section of
    the River Ward for his Port of Call Exchange. The Exchange is the largest
    trading company in southern Anuire, dealing in everything from fine silks to
    exotic wines to cattle and other live- stock. El-Hadid also has guild
    holdings in Roesone, Medoere and several other domains across Cerilia. It is
    also well known that el-Hadid is partial owner of the resort town of Aenier.


    El-Hadid is by far the most powerful and most dangerous NPC in all of Ilien.
    Some ten years ago, one of el-Hadid's chief competitors was mysteriously
    murdered, and since that time the guildlord's activities have been under
    some scrutiny by the constabulary. No charges of misconduct have ever been
    brought against el-Hadid, but prudent char- acters should be very careful
    when dealing with him or his men.


    El-Hadid employs nearly 400 traders, caravan masters and guards to protect
    his investments in Ilien. He has employees in additional domains, as well as
    other unknown contacts who serve in his network of spies and paid
    informants. He also has a secret arsenal of magical items (including his
    ring of human influence) which he uses to further his own greedy ends.


    One thorn in el-Hadid's side is his inability to dominate Ilien's cattle
    trade. This is due in part mostly to the interference of the late Moeran
    Aglondier. Moeran discovered el-Hadid's practices early on, but by then the
    Khinasi trader already had his hooks so deep into the Free City's economy
    that bringing him down completely would have seriously disrupted trade in
    the domain. Instead, Moeran set about making sure he did not gain control of
    the cattle market, saving Ilien's farmers from being cheated out of their
    own profits. Moeran then went one step further to help ensure true free
    trade in the - city by appointing chancellors Kathaen Abeth and . Moro
    Mentier. Both are former traders whose businesses were destroyed through
    el-Hadid's shady tactics, and both keep a sharp eye on Hadid. Agents of the
    chancellors also operate trading companies supported by the regent to offer
    competition to the Port of Call Exchange, making sure farmers and cattle
    herders receive fair prices for cattle they bring to Ilien, Goewhyn, or
    Tennien.

  name: Heirl Diem
  description: >-
    Diemed's warrior baron, Heirl Diem (MA; F7; Br, major, 42; LN), is a direct
    descendant of the founder of Diemed. Those who deal with this canny
    politician and cunning strategist realize most of his actions have a secret
    motivation or form part of a trick; sometimes the baron uses this reputation
    to his advantage by doing exactly what he claims, and nothing more. For this
    reason, other regents fear engaging in diplomatic relations with him—they
    don't know what he intends, and they have few chances to find out before
    he's succeeded.


    The baron seeks perfect order in his kingdom and allows no lawbreaker to go
    unpunished. His justice is fair and even-handed, though, extending from the
    lowliest commoner to his own family. The punishments vary not in the
    slightest depending on social class. The baron does not believe in
    exceptions.


    *   **Lieutenants**: Diem has at least four trusted lieutenants who
    constitute an extensive spy network, in both his own and neighboring
    kingdoms. His secret sources allow him to quickly respond to internal
    threats or external pressures with a minimum of inconvenience. Some say his
    own daughter, Lasica (FA; W5; Br, major, 42; LN), works as one of these
    spies.

However, he did not descend from the ancient bloodlines. Rogr never felt so astonished as the morning he woke up to discover he had inherited the old man's bloodline, his royal name, and the Free County of Ilien. The count rules Ilien wisely and well, doing his best not to make the mistakes of the regents around him. Neither ambitious nor proud, he's willing to admit his faults. His people enthusiastically support him, for he keeps their loyalty high and their taxes low. Aglondier claims Ilien is neutral, a statement that strays a bit from the truth. He's good friends with the rulers from both Medoere and Roesone—without their tolerance, his domain wouldn't exist. Still, the nonpartisan illusion persists, so other rulers use the Free County of Ilien as a neutral meeting spot; regents have forged numerous treaties there.\n\n*   Lieutenants: Despite his many good qualities, Aglondier isn't really the trusting sort. His only lieutenant is his daughter and heir, the Lady Alliene (FA; Pr3, Nesirie; CG).

Rogr was a com- moner, fascinated by magic, when he met the Count and became his pupil. He studied magic, though as an unblooded human had no chance of rising far in the ranks of true magic spellcasting. Moeran took him as an apprentice, and having no other family, made plans to pass the regency on to Rogr. Now, with Moeran's untimely death, the fledgling Rogr is thrust into the regency of Ilien unexpectedly.\n\nRogr is an extremely intelligent individual, and the power he possesses coupled with the teachings of the old Count and his own growing skill makes him a formidable ruler. Rogr is the only known wizard in Ilien.\n\nRogr is a widower, his wife having died during the birth of his daughter Alliene. Alliene is a member of the Eastern Temple of Nesirie, and Rogr's only trusted lieutenant.\n\nThe suspected assassination of Moeran has unnerved the new regent of the land. Despite the assurances of Seneschal Godene, Rogr remains extremely paranoid about a potential assassin loose in the Free City.\n\n*   Rogr was born as a son of simple craftsman and had fairly rough childhood\n*   He shown signs of great intellect was educated on the Moeran Aglondier stipend, and in time bacome clerk, apprentice, advisor and friend of count\n*   He became father early - at 17 and widower at 23\_\n*   In his magic he is great at practice - he is able to perform spell perfectly after reading it-s description once - but not so great at theory, abstraction and synthesis.\n*   He have a talent to combine magical and mundane means and knack for finding solutions that most mages would not think of.\n*   He see himself as a servant of the people of Ilien and legacy of Aglondier counts, he will ignore personal attacks but fight fierce when city is threatened\n*   He is not accustomed to political maneuvering, he knows it happen but until recently he was focusing on finding best solutions not making them pass amid resistance\n*   He likes cooking and do not think to stop even when he is a count\n*   He was accustomed to work directly with the count and do not know who of the numerous advisors and officials can he trust and with what\n*   He often wears old hat - a gift from late wife - as remembrance of her - even when it is not very fitting occasion"

  name: The Seadrake
  description: >-
    About 600 years ago, when the Roeles still lived to rule Anuire, an Anuirean
    merchant named Garrilein Suliere sailed the Straits of Aerele, selling
    grains, steel, and fabrics from Anuire in Mieres, and returning with a cargo
    hold full of gold and spices. It was a good life; he profited from the trade
    and helped make others wealthy as well.


    Occasionally, he would supplement his cargo with passengers. One mysterious
    passenger, who paid his weight in gold, proved to be Garrilein's undoing.
    Though the passage across the Straits lasts only a day, this day would
    irrevocably change Garrilein's life.


    A storm boiled up, and the passenger's cloak was blown from his face. He was
    scaled and horned, a horrible lizard-like creature, and he began to
    slaughter the crew where they stood. Though Garrilein was only an average
    warrior, he couldn't stand idle while his crew was slaughtered. Summoning
    all his meager courage, he crept up behind the beast and drove a harpoon
    through its back. It expired on the harpoon, cursing him all the while.


    Whether it was the curse, or whether the slaying awoke Garrilein's latent
    blood, he gradually took on the beast's scales over the next few years. He
    soon could not show his face in public and was forced to deal through
    intermediaries and couriers. His appearance continued to worsen, until at
    last he slipped into the sea in an attempt to kill himself.


    He found that immersion in water couldn't kill him; instead, the salt water
    of the Straits hastened his transformation and he eventually became a small
    sea serpent. The years have rendered him larger and more powerful; and
    although he is not actively evil, his transformation continues without
    cease.


    Although he now has little use for it, the Seadrake still collects treasure.
    Though he can no longer increase his fortune through honest work, he can now
    take it from the captains of the vessels that ply the Straits of Aerele. He
    has terrorized ships for the past 500 years, and after the first few
    decades, few dared deny him the treasure he seeks.


    However, the Seadrake does not take lives unless forced to do so in
    self-defense. He makes an exception for the pirate ships that attempt to
    steal what would be his. Apparently, he feels some obligation to earn the
    money he takes from the merchants; killing the pirates is his trade-off.


    The Seadrake appears as a 50-foot-long serpent with a large, fan-like crest
    adorning his back. He is mottled green and blue, and he blends easily into
    the sometimes turbulent waters of the Straits. Fangs fill his mouth, and the
    flukes on his forequarters propel him powerfully through the water. He bears
    no trace of his former humanity except for his morals and his ability to
    understand all human speech.


    The Seadrake can breathe both water and air without difficulty, but he has
    trouble moving on land. Although he has been known to pursue enemies onto
    dry land, he prefers the water, where he's more maneuverable and more
    dangerous.


    **Combat**: Ship captains give tribute to the Seadrake with little fuss for
    good reason. His bite causes 3dlO damage, enough to rend a normal man in a
    single pass of razor-sharp teeth. Alternatively, he can make a crushing
    attack with his two tremendous flukes, each causing 2d8 damage. Any
    breakable object must save vs. crushing blow when hit by his flippers or be
    shattered.


    The Seadrake has recently discovered that his great size confers two
    additional forms of attack. He is now of a size such that he can swallow
    man-sized enemies; when he attacks with his bite, a roll of a natural 19 or
    20 means that his victim has been swallowed whole. The victim suffers 1d20
    damage passing over rows of teeth and into the Seadrake's gullet, then has
    Id6 rounds to cut himself free (by causing 20 points of damage to AC 5)
    before he drowns and burns to death in powerful stomach bile. Only weapons
    of size S can be used to cut him; there is no room to wield larger weapons.


    The creature's other newly found attack is his crushing coil. He can wrap
    his length around any ship with a deck width of 20 feet or less and crush
    it. If the ship's wood fails a save vs. crushing blow, the hull splinters
    and the ship slowly sinks.


    The Seadrake can spit an ink-cloud from under his flukes to assist his
    escape. The ink acts as a darkness spell with a 50- foot radius underwater;
    it is ineffective above water.


    The Seadrake regenerates 2 hp per round while his wounds are underwater. If
    a wound is exposed to air for more than 3 rounds, it must heal normally. If
    reduced to -10 hit points, the Seadrake dies.


    **Habitat/Society**: The Seadrake has no society. He lives alone in a grotto
    under Baerghos Isle, gazing upon his treasure. A primitive tribe is said to
    live on the isle and worship the Seadrake as a god, but no one has set foot
    on the island in over two centuries to verify this.


    **Ecology**: The Seadrake patrols the Straits of Aerele, eating sharks and
    whales. If these are not available, he can survive on plankton or seaweed.
    He drags the tribute donated to him by sailors eager to avoid his wrath to
    his under- water grotto. A few reckless adventurers have pilfered from this
    grotto over the years, and many more plan carefully to enter when the
    Seadrake is away, but this is a foolish venture, for the Seadrake keeps no
    schedule, and can return at any instant. Despite his generally passive
    nature, he will kill anyone who tampers with his treasure. Although he has
    no use for the treasure, he enjoys its company and guards it jealously.


    A theory has been offered that the Seadrake collects treasure to remind him
    of his lost humanity. Some say he would do anything to regain that life, or
    to end this one. They're wrong in one respect - he fights viciously when
    attacked, as if he were afraid of death.


    Travelers on the Straits should be warned: Though the Seadrake can be
    bargained with, he demands tribute. He is nothing less than unreasonable if
    denied. No one has lived to tell a tale of escaping the Seadrake by
    promising to return with more gold. Though he is greedy, he is not stupid.
    No one escapes an encounter with the Seadrake with a full purse.

    # Blood Derivation


    A character can be a scion of one of the old goods


    *   Andurias, the god of noble war

    *   Azrai the shadow, the face of evil

    *   Basaia, the queen of the sun

    *   Brenna, the goddess of commerce and fortune

    *   Masela, the lady of the seas

    *   Reynir, the god of the woods and streams

    *   Vorynn, the lord of moon and magic


    Scions of Azrai are called awnsheling (awnsheghlien) and are twisted by the
    dark power.


    # Blood Strength


    Bloodline could have following strength


    *   Tainted

    *   Minor

    *   Major

    *   Great

    *   True


    Tainted bloodlines are almost completely degenerated or are new bloodlines
    created by bloodtheft by unbloodied character.


    Minor bloodlines are usually descendants of common men present at Deismaar.


    Major bloodlines are usually descendants of commanders and heroes of Deismar
    or minor bloodlines elevated by heroic deeds.


    Great bloodlines are usually descendants of greatest heroes of Deismar or
    major bloodlines elevated by epic deeds.


    True bloodlines are direct descendants of divine champions fighting at
    Deismar .


    # Bloodline Score


    Bloodline score is described by integer number. Bloodied player character
    starts with score of 5 plus 10 points for each strength level after tainted.


    # Investiture


    By performing a complex ritual character can pass his bloodline to another.
    Both characters have to be present and willing (but may be coerced).


    If target is unbloodied it gains source character's derivation, score and
    strength.


    If target is bloodied it gains one half of the source's score. Target
    retains stronger bloodline strength. The person performing ritual decides
    about derivation.


    Source become unbloodied.


    # Bloodtheft


    When bloodied character is slain by piercing the heart the killer can get
    part of victim power. He gets one point per level of target bloodline
    strength (but no more than target score). If killer is unbloodied he gains
    Tainted bloodline of victim's derivation.


    If the kill is made with _tighmaevril_ weapon it grants one half of the
    target bloodline score and the kill does not have to pierce the heart.


    If the victim have different bloodline derivation then the killer then the
    killer have to success on charisma medium (15) saving throw or gain victim's
    derivation. If the victim blood is stronger then the save is done at
    disadvantage, if weaker then at advantage. If the victim is of Azrai blood
    then the save is though (20).


    # Offspring


    When bloodied character breed the offspring can inherit the power. The child
    have stronger parent blood strength, average of both parents scores and
    stronger parent's derivation (in case of ties score decides, then fate). If
    one of parents is unbloodied then progeny have one half of bloodied parent
    score, one level lesser strength and the same derivation.


    # Improving Bloodline


    Bloodied regent can draw power from the land to improve his bloodline score.
    The bloodline strength can be only archived by heroic (or in case of Azrai
    horrific) deeds.


    ## Bloodmark


    Blooded character is marked as a scion by some visible body alteration, like
    birthmark, strangely colored strand of hair or something similar. Bloodmark
    become more pronounced as blood becomes stronger. Characters recognizing
    bloodline can react accordingly.


    # Heritage


    As a heritage of old goods bloodied character have one additional point in
    attributes based on derivation


    *   Anduiras - Str

    *   Reynir - Con

    *   Brenna - Dex

    *   Basaia - Int

    *   Masela - Cha

    *   Vorynn - Wis

    *   Azrai - choose two


    # Blood abilities


    For each started 10 points of bloodline score the character posses one blood
    ability. Character cannot have ability more potent than his bloodline
    strength. Character should not have more stronger abilities than weaker.
    There are no specific list of abilities only suggestions of the ability
    power level, abilities should be thematically linked to blood derivation.


    ## Tainted


    Tainted bloodlines does not grant blood abilities.


    ## Minor


    *   Cantrip usable once between short rests

    *   Doubling proficiency bonus in specific circumstances

    *   Bonus proficiency

    *   Ability score improvement

    *   Slowed aging


    ## Major


    *   1st level spell usable once between short rests

    *   Resistance for one damage type

    *   Advantage on selected attribute check in specific circumstances

    *   Special sense (darkvision, blindsense, ...) or improved existing one

    *   Communication and friendship with one selected kind of animal


    ## Great


    *   2nd-3rd level spell usable once between short rests

    *   Advantage on selected attribute check in general circumstances

    *   Wild shape for one selected kind of animal

    *   Environmental adaptation (water breathing, immunity to nonmagical flame,
    feeding from sunlight,...)

    *   Small natural or magical armor bonus


    ## True


    Anything that DM agrees on.

  name: Calendar
  description: >
    A year has 388 days. The four annual days not part of any month have become
    times to celebrate and reflect. These days fall on the vernal equinox (the
    Day of Rebirth), the summer solstice (the Night of Fire, when a shower of
    falling stars results from annual passage through a meteor belt at the
    climax of Haelyn's Festival), the autumnal equinox (the Veneration of the
    Sleeping), and the winter solstice (the Eve of the Dead).


    # Months, days, and years


    The 12 months of the Anuirean calendar begin with the Day of Rebirth, the
    vernal equinox. The month Sarimiere is the first of the new year, followed
    by Talienir, then Roelir. After Haelyn's Festival, the month of Haelynir
    begins. Anarire and Deismir (named for the Godswar's final battle) follow in
    succession, with the Veneration of the Sleeping next. Erntenir, the month of
    harvest, leads to Sehnir, then Emmanir, just before the Eve of the Dead.
    Then comes the coldest month, Keltier, which flows into Faniele, then
    Pasiphiel, and again, the Day of Rebirth.


    Anuireans devote six of the week's eight days to work, giving the remainder
    over to leisure. The days, from work's beginning to rest's end, are: Firlen,
    Relen, Dielen, Varilen, Branlen, Barlen, Mierlen, and Taelen.


    Almost 2,000 years after the destruction of the old gods, Anuire's current
    yearly reckoning is 551 Michaeline (551MR), or 551 years after the death of
    Michael Roele, last Emperor of Anuire. In Khinasi lands, the year is 2039 MA
    (dating from the Masetian Arrival in Cerilia). In certain other parts of
    Cerilia, the year is 1524 HC (Haelyn's Count), recording the years since the
    battle of Mount Deismaar.

    The characters proposed a solution where the High Capitan would be either
    kidnapped and replaced by a double or controlled by some vile means and
    therefore not responsible for the situation.

    Gael agreed that it would be some solution but put three challenges in front
    of the characters, creating a "waterproof" story, making all with something
    to say in province to accept the story and then removing the numerous The
    Southern Anuire Shipping and Imports personnel that would oppose the plan by
    force.

    explained Hormund that she have slightly diffirent plan.

    who was directly representing Orthien Thane in Abbadiel instead.

    She explained that Gilberto really worked for the man and would be not to
    happy to have him eliminated but that he is pragmatist that will accept
    established reality.

    She needed Hormund and his companions as unaligned agents to execute the
    attack - and explained that without centrall authority remaining players

    give them free reign and they would not save any time by staying in Geowhyn
    and waiting for approval from the count administration.

    wind in pursuit of dastardly villain.

    wielding Eldritch Powers and the Holly Man propelled by Divine Fury.

    dozens of bandits.

    surrounded by deep - almost physical darkness.

    ## Eternal Night - The Storm Tower in The Shadow Realm

    After crossing the door the party entered the tower-top.

    There was no sky in there and the tower was surrounded by some semi-material
    figures fighting each other in eternal struggle.

    They went down the stairs and noticed a ghastly figure facing a scrying
    bowl.

    Second similar figure joined the first steeping through the floor.


    Ormus and DUnmro talked to the figures trying to learn where and when they
    are.

    They managed not to offend their interlocutor and in the end agreed to
    exchange an armor that the party found on some dead elf - which apparently
    had some emotional value - for another one.

    After disembarking from Shaemas boat Ormus, Hormund and Dunmro entered the
    settlement.

    They observed a celebration of retirement of about a dozen of the older
    pirates.

    They noticed that the locals had taken treasures from a Tower and decorated
    the retires with them.  

    Hormund tried to find a challenger for a duel but was told to drink instead,
    he was pointed to Vos settlement if he would like to get beaten up.

    Dunmro tried to get some information on whereabouts of  Delvin Boria but
    failed to get anything significant.

    cheating but managed to defuse the situation.

    ## Night - The Isle of Tamale

    The party set up a camp far from the settlement.

    They secured the place using several spells.

    # 29.09.1524

    ## Morning - The Isle of Tamale

    While Dunmro and Ormus prepared their spells Hormund tried to use his
    ability to see through animal eyes to get a bird-view of the isle.

    Unfortunately all the birds he tried to use were quickly intercepted and
    killed by an unnatural swarms of hostile birds.

    Dunmro and Ormus tried to protect the scouting-birds by incinerating the
    swarms with fireballs but in the end Hormund decided that it is to risky for
    the birds to continue.

    ## Noon - The Isle of Tamale

    The party reached the mountain ridge in the center of the isle.

    They found elven ruins and an inland lake from which free sailors were
    taking water.

    The party searched the ruins and found a tunnel leading down.

    The tunnel was blocked by stone doors enchanted by powerful spell.

    The party searched ruins further and found an amphitheater facing the sea
    with traces of bloody sacrifice.

    Hormund explored the cliff and found three dead bodies.

    Dunmro went after him but fallen to a chasm finding forth body.

    The party noticed some shapes under the waves and Hormund went to check
    them.

    In the meantime Dunmro and Ormus reached entry to another tunnel located on
    the cliff face.

    Hormund found out that there is another set of elven ruins underwater but
    was not able to explore them too much because of the depth and rough sea.

    ## Afternoon - Underground Tunnels on The Isle of Tamale

    The party explored the tunnel and reached an intersection.

    The way forward was blocked by stone and spell so the party decided to
    proceed with one of the two open tunnels.

    The party noticed some kind arrow slits in the walls then reached a chamber.

    In the chamber they encountered two bodies who raised to meet them with red
    glow in their eyes.

    The party attacked the creatures and killed them before second one succeeded
    in attempt to escape.

    The part explored eight of the side doors in the chamber and found some kind
    of armory holding few elaborate swords.

    They found a lever at the end of one of checked corridors.

    Hormund pulled the lever collapsing the main corridor and trapping the part
    underground.


    The party pushed forward, encountering another chamber with narrow bridge
    across a chasm.

    They crossed the bridge and prevented Hormund from pulling lever on the
    other side.


    Next they encountered huge chamber with water on the floor, glowing
    grapevine and a rare tree in the center.

    Dunmro noticed some white silhouette on second gallery above the chamber.

    Hormund used rope and a hook to climb to the gallery.

    In the meantime Ormus and DUnmro explored ground level gallery where they
    found a row of elven statues, and a stream of water going around the main
    chamber.

    Hormund used the rope to pull Dunmro and Ormus up.

    They explored the second level gallery and dound several cambers.

    In one they found some kind of underground garden, in another some kind of
    living quarters and workshop.

    In the third they found a waterfall, and behind the waterfall a stairs to
    the first level gallery.

    In the gallery they noticed the white silhouette coming out from the floor
    behind them.

    They rushed to meet the creature and encountered some pale, masked, vaguely
    elf shaped humanoid, apparently understanding and speaking Andu.

    They tried to get some information from the creature but did not get too
    much apart of suggestion that they are not welcome here, and that they
    should look in the surface for those who performed sacrifice.

    The creature agreed to lead them out of underground and lead them through a
    mazer of twisted passages and stairs leaving them in staircase leading
    directly to surface.

    ## Evening - The Free Sailors port on The Isle of Tamale

    The party traded one of the found swords for breakfast and stopped to

    treasurer.

    They learned location of the Vos fortress and about some vile individuals
    who perform their profane rituals in ruins and sometimes visit the town to
    buy prisoners.

    The party asked to see the prisoners and Pete allowed them to meet four
    sailors who worked fro Darien Avan.

    They did not reach agreement to buy the prisoners.

    ## Night -  The Isle of Tamale

    The party set up a camp at some distance from the town and protected the
    campsite by magic.

    During the night each of the characters was visited in their dreams by a
    mysterious character, who asked what they look for and what did bring them
    into his domain.

    While Ormus and Hormund did not see much apart of shadow and their own
    idealized representation Dunmro was able to explore some ghastly landscape
    resembling to some extent the elven ruins on the isle.

    # 30.09.1524

    ## Noon -  The Isle of Tamale

    After waking up and finishing preparation the party set of to the Vos
    fortress.


    Around noon at some narrow hill path they noticed that somebody is ineptly
    trying to hide from them.

    Hormund ran ahead and captured a Vos warrior.

    The party started interrogating the prisoner when Dunmro noticed there are
    more of the up the slope.

    Hormund started to climb when the party noticed a group of Vos approaching
    from the front and heard a voice urging them to stand down and come with
    them.

    Hormund reached position of the second Vos warrior and started wrestling
    with him but the Vos managed to push him from the slope.

    Hormund landed on top of Dunmro and resumed climb immediately.


    Ormus and Dunmro advanced and met with the Vos ahead.

    Hormund reached his adversary and managed to throw him off the slope.

    for now.


    The party continued to Vos Fortress accompanied by warriors.

    ## Afternoon - Vos Fortress on The Isle of Tamale

    The party was admitted to the fortress.

    They noticed numerous towers and walls made from loose stone, many Vos
    warriors and numerous slaves.


    The party was brought before the Vos War-chief Boris Cesarevich Dantiev.

    The Vos were impressed by Hormund stature and dismissed Dunmro and
    especially Ormus as weaklings.

    The Vos invited Hormund to show of his might in tonight arena fights.

    The War-chief introduced other Vos leaders as Ludmilla Ivanova, Fabio
    Giuseppovich and Alexandr Gustavovich who did not fit the environment and
    was threated with disrespect by everybody.

    The Party asked to see The Priest who was spiritual leader of the community
    but was told that the priest is too busy.


    The Party ate some food and gathered information about Vos and slaves in the
    fortress.

    They met with Alexandr Gustavovich and discussed potential collaboration but
    without any commitment from both sides.

    ## Night - Vos Fortress on The Isle of Tamale

    The fights in arena started with slave and junior melee.


    Dunmro volunteered to fight in the heavyweight free-for-all.

    As the fight started Dunmro summoned righteous spirits to protect him and
    Ormus shape-shifted him into gigantic lizard.

    Unfortunately this focused all other participant on taking down the huge
    monster and he soon lost concentration necessary to keep the spirits
    summoned.

    Shortly after that the monster went down and Ormus once again polymorphed
    Dunmro.

    The second time he did not fare much better and returned to his own form
    after wounding many and eating single Vos.

    He tried to summon spirits again but the Priest dispelled his spell.

    Shortly afterwards Dunmro went down in his true form and Hormund joined the
    fight to prevent cleric from dying.


    After administering a healing potion Hormund beat up every remaining
    participant.

    In response the Priest invited more volunteers to fight the newcomer.

    Five of them come forward and were beaten up in short succession.

    The priest called for more volunteers and after none stood up he named Fabio
    Giuseppovich to go down and beat up Hormund.

    Fabio tried hard but ultimately failed and went down.


    There were calls for fight with Boris Cesarevich but Hormund suggested next
    day for that and War-chief accepted.

    He summoned Hormund for celebration.

    ## Night - Vos Fortress on The Isle of Tamale

    The Vos cellebrated Hormund's arena victories.

    They drank to their strength.

    They drank to their glory.

    They drank to their loot.

    They drank to damnation of their enemies.


    After much of drinking one Vos challenged heritage of Hormund who defended
    himself skilfully.

    After more drinking another Vow challenged Hormund to drinking contest -
    Hormund won but not without showing serious signs of intoxication.

    After even more drinking one more Vos challenged Hormund youth and manliness
    - Hormund defended himself and one of Vos womand offered to take him to a
    ride and settle question of manliness.

    They drank once again and Hormund passed out.


    In the meantime Ormus and Dunmro looked for safe place to sleep.

    They looked into Vos barracks but after that they found slaves enclosure.

    They meet tow slaves on the lookout for the Vos Livia and Albert.

    Ormus being himself instantly persuaded that they can not be Vos.

    Dunmro and Ormus questioned the slaves about their situation and asked for a
    place to stay.

    They were lead by Livia into a hidding place created inside the wall that
    allowed them to sleep undisturbed.

    ## Night - Vos Fortress on The Isle of Tamale

    Ormus dreamed that he is flying through the shadow.

    He landed on an stone tower that he recognized as a Sun Spire after few
    moments.

    A voice in back of his head asked him how far he is ready to go to gain the
    knowledge he covets and then the dream has ended.

    ## Night - Vos Fortress on The Isle of Tamale

    Dunmro dreamt that he wander in the shadowy representation of elven ruins.

    He found a path that led him to a stone decorated with glowing runes and his
    dream has ended.

    ## Morning - Vos Fortress on The Isle of Tamale

    Hormind was woken by the Vos woman who told hiom priest are looking for him,
    and is expecting him on the stone pillar in the middle of arena.

    He went there expecting Dunmro but met the Vos priest instead.

    The Vos priest tried to sell a vision of glorious future with Hormund
    leading the Vos to scourge anuerian coast.

    Hormund remained skeptical but did not tell that to the Priest.

    After finishing the talk Hormund was led by the Vos woman to the "kitchen"
    for a breakfast.

    He learned that the woman was called Ludmilla.


    Dunmro and Ormus woke up queried the slaves and scouted the slave enclosure
    ant then the whole fortress.

    They encountered Hormund and Dunmro proposed to go to the ruins because he
    have to check something there.

    ## Afternoon - The Isle of Tamale

    The party moved to the ruins and located the stone from Dunmro dream.

    They found a staircase leading down into the rock.

    They discussed plans for the evening fight and dealing with the Vos priest.

    Dunmro and Ormus studied runes decorating the walls while Hormund pressed
    ahead and opened sealed doors by blindly pressing runes.


    They found a large chamber with three elven figures frozen in poses
    indicating they were weaving some spell.

    The figures were surrounded by magical runes and discarded magical component
    and items.

    Ormus used fly spell to avid touching runes on the floor and the party
    examined the bodies.

    They found a magical dagger, ring and an amulet.

    They encountered a side chamber and magically sealed passage.


    Ormus discovered that that password written on the walls of the staircase
    also opens and closes the entry doors.

    ## Evening - Vos Fortress on The Isle of Tamale

    After returning to the Vos Fortress Hormund was warned by Ludmila that the
    Priest ordered to have them watched constantly.

    Hormund faced the Chief Boris on the arena.

    Boris fought fiercely but luck was not on his side and after breaking his ax
    on Hormund and unsuccessfully trying to wrestle him he was beaten
    unconsciously.


    After making short work of the tribe chief Hormund was celebrated as a
    champion by Vos.

    There was a lot of chearing and a lot more of drinking.


    Dunmro noticed that they are watched by a group of about then Vos.

    # 01.10.1524 HC

    ## Night - Vos Fortress on The Isle of Tamale

    Dunmro removed alcohol effects from Hormund who in turn took a barrel of
    booze and drunk the remaining watchers unconsciously.

    He misinterpreted effect of the priest spell and needed another cleansing to
    be ready for action.


    The three heroes attacked the Vos priest temple from three sides using rope
    bridges.

    Ormus used a spell to conjure foh and hide their approach.

    The priest reacted quickly and retreated into narrow crevasse inside stone
    pillar.

    Dunmro and Hormund went after the Priest but they blocked each other in the
    narrow space.

    Eventually Hormund went first and pursued their target in darkness.
